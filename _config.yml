author: Michael D. Hensley
description: Often, fungi are either overlooked or believed to be omnipotent. They are incredible organisms that deserve more attention but should be recognized 
as Earthly organisms like the rest of us. They may not save us but they are incredible none the less. As the world's biodiversity slips, we need to include fungi in our efforts of conservation. The question should not be, "what can fungi do for us", but, "what can we do for fungi".  # This will show up in places like twitter, linkedin, etc, if you share your sites url as a post.
